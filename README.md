# What is markdown ?

This is a demo to show the markdown formats.   
Let's try a few different things.

## Number 1 Bold

This is a **BOLD** text.

## Number 2 Italic

This is a *ITALIC* word.

## Number 3 blockquote

This is to show how a block looks like:      
> Hi I am a block.       
> Hi I am still in block
>> Hi I am in a block in block
